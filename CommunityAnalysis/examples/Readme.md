# README
The functions of each file are introduced.
## cow_weighted_Louvain_\*\_area.ipynb
Contents:
1. An example of how to run weighted Louvain algorithm on different area.
2. NMI
3. In feeding area, some codes to check intersection between communities of 2 days are shown.
4. In all area, there are some codes for random simulation.
## clique_percolation_method.ipynb
Contents:
1. An example of how to run CPM algorithm.  
2. onmi function's path in the repository: CompSci_4/CommunityAnalysis/pycowview/onmi-master/onmi.py
## Girvan-Newman.ipynb
Contents:
1. An example of how to run GN algorithm.  
2. Get the total cowlist in the 14 days （All cows that have appeared once will be counted in a cowlist）.  
3. Compute betweenness.
## cow_unweighted_Louvain.ipynb
Contents:
1. An example of how to run unweighted Louvain algorithm.  
2. Compute the similarity of graphs (networks) in the 14 days.  
3. NMI result.
4. Nodes of N highest degree each day
## graph_statistics.ipynb
This file is to compute the density, number of nodes and edges of graph.
## plot_figures_for_report.ipynb
This file is to plot relevant figures for community detection part in the report.  
The values may be different with those in the report because the random seed is not set and the result of each run is different.
